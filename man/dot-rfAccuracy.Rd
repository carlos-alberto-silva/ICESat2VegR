\title{Internal confusion matrix accuracy}
\usage{
.rfAccuracy(cmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmat}{Confusion matrix with rows = reference (true) classes and
columns = predicted classes.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{PCC} - overall percent correctly classified.
\item \code{kappa} - Cohen's kappa coefficient.
\item \code{producers.accuracy} - vector of producer's accuracy per class.
}
}
\description{
Internal helper to compute overall PCC, producer's accuracy and kappa from
a confusion matrix. Adapted conceptually from \code{rfUtilities::accuracy}.
