\title{Maps to \code{ee.Image.glcmTexture}}
\usage{
glcmTexture(x, size = 1, kernel = NULL, average = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The input image to calculate the texture on.}

\item{size}{integer, default 1. The size of the neighborhood to include in each GLCM.}

\item{kernel}{default NULL. A kernel specifying the x and y offsets over which to compute
the GLCMs. A GLCM is computed for each pixel in the kernel that is non-zero, except the
center pixel and as long as a GLCM hasn't already been computed for the same direction and
distance. For example, if either or both of the east and west pixels are set, only 1
(horizontal) GLCM is computed. Kernels are scanned from left to right and top to bottom.
The default is a 3x3 square, resulting in 4 GLCMs with the offsets
(-1, -1), (0, -1), (1, -1) and (-1, 0).}

\item{average}{logical, default TRUE. If true, the directional bands for each metric are
averaged.}
}
\value{
Another Earth Engine image with bands described on details section.
}
\description{
Computes texture metrics from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix around
each pixel of every band. The GLCM is a tabulation of how often different
combinations of pixel brightness values (grey levels) occur in an image. It
counts the number of times a pixel of value X lies next to a pixel of value Y, in a
particular direction and distance. and then derives statistics from this
tabulation.
}
\details{
This implementation computes the 14 GLCM metrics proposed by Haralick, and
4 additional metrics from Conners. Inputs are required to be integer valued.

The output consists of 18 bands per input band if directional averaging is on
and 18 bands per directional pair in the kernel, if not:
\enumerate{
\item ASM: f1, Angular Second Moment; measures the number of repeated pairs
\item CONTRAST: f2, Contrast; measures the local contrast of an image
\item CORR: f3, Correlation; measures the correlation between pairs of pixels
\item VAR: f4, Variance; measures how spread out the distribution of gray-levels is
\item IDM: f5, Inverse Difference Moment; measures the homogeneity
\item SAVG: f6, Sum Average
\item SVAR: f7, Sum Variance
\item SENT: f8, Sum Entropy
\item ENT: f9, Entropy. Measures the randomness of a gray-level distribution
\item DVAR: f10, Difference variance
\item DENT: f11, Difference entropy
\item IMCORR1: f12, Information Measure of Corr. 1
\item IMCORR2: f13, Information Measure of Corr. 2
\item MAXCORR: f14, Max Corr. Coefficient. (not computed)
\item DISS: Dissimilarity
\item INERTIA: Inertia
\item SHADE: Cluster Shade
\item PROM: Cluster prominence
