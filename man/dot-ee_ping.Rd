\title{Check if Google Earth Engine is initialized}
\usage{
.ee_ping(ee)
}
\arguments{
\item{ee}{The Earth Engine Python module as returned by
\code{reticulate::import("ee")}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if Earth Engine is initialized and responsive.
Otherwise, an error is thrown indicating that Earth Engine must be
authenticated and initialized.
}
\description{
\code{.ee_ping()} verifies that the Earth Engine Python API is initialized and
responsive. It attempts to evaluate a trivial Earth Engine expression
(\code{ee$Image$constant(1)$getInfo()}) and returns invisibly if successful.
If the call fails, an error is raised with a hint to authenticate and
initialize Earth Engine.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  library(reticulate)
  ee <- import("ee", delay_load = FALSE)

  # Will error if EE is not authenticated/initialized
  .ee_ping(ee)
}
