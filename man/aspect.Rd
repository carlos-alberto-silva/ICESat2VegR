\title{Compute terrain aspect (degrees) from a DEM image}
\usage{
aspect(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{ee$Image} representing a DEM from which aspect will be derived.}
}
\value{
An \code{ee$Image} with one band named \code{aspect} containing aspect
values in degrees clockwise from north.
}
\description{
Computes the terrain \emph{aspect} in degrees for each pixel of an Earth Engine
\code{ee$Image} representing a digital elevation model (DEM).

Aspect describes the downslope direction of the steepest gradient and is
expressed in degrees clockwise from north. The computation is performed
using Earth Engine's built-in \code{ee$Terrain$aspect()} function. As with slope,
Earth Engine uses the 4-connected neighborhood, so missing values may occur
near image edges.

\dontrun{
  ee <- reticulate::import("ee")
  dem <- ee$Image("NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001")
  asp <- aspect(dem)
